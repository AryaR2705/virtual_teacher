"ER model stands for an Entity-Relationship model. It is a high-level data model. This model is used to define the data elements and relationship for a specified system.
It develops a conceptual design for the database. It also develops a very simple and easy to design view of data.
In ER modeling, the database structure is portrayed as a diagram called an entity-relationship diagram.",5
"Database normalization is used in a database management system (DBMS), specifically with relational databases, to decrease redundant information and therefore minimize data anomalies. Anomalies can occur from information that is poorly grouped or redundant and can cause a range of effects, such as incorrect data insertion or the deletion of a whole group of data. By using database normalization, these anomalies are avoided, and memory typically is freed up so that the database can function more efficiently. Normalization functions should be used periodically, about once a week, to keep the database fresh and free of unexpected problems.",5
"It has decreased the risk of data management, i.e., manipulation of data will not affect the core data.
Data consistency is maintained as it manages data in a central repository.
It provides better data quality, which enables organizations to establish data standards.
It is less costly because fewer vendors are required to handle the data sets.",5
"RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems like MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.
A Relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as introduced by E. F. Codd.",5
"The design of a DBMS depends on its architecture. It can be centralized or decentralized or hierarchical. The architecture of a DBMS can be seen as either single tier or multi-tier. An n-tier architecture divides the whole system into related but independent n modules, which can be independently modified, altered, changed, or replaced.",5
"In 1-tier architecture, the DBMS is the only entity where the user directly sits on the DBMS and uses it. Any changes done here will directly be done on the DBMS itself. It does not provide handy tools for end-users. Database designers and programmers normally prefer to use single-tier architecture.",5
"If the architecture of DBMS is 2-tier, then it must have an application through which the DBMS can be accessed. Programmers use 2-tier architecture where they access the DBMS by means of an application. Here the application tier is entirely independent of the database in terms of operation, design, and programming.",5
"A 3-tier architecture separates its tiers from each other based on the complexity of the users and how they use the data present in the database. It is the most widely used architecture to design a DBMS.Database (Data) Tier âˆ’ At this tier, the database resides along with its query processing languages. We also have the relations that define the data and their constraints at this level.
Application (Middle) Tier âˆ’ At this tier reside the application server and the programs that access the database. For a user, this application tier presents an abstracted view of the database. End-users are unaware of any existence of the database beyond the application. At the other end, the database tier is not aware of any other user beyond the application tier. Hence, the application layer sits in the middle and acts as a mediator between the end-user and the database.
User (Presentation) Tier âˆ’ End-users operate on this tier and they know nothing about any existence of the database beyond this layer. At this layer, multiple views of the database can be provided by the application. All views are generated by applications that reside in the application tier.",5
"This property states that a transaction must be treated as an atomic unit, that is, either all of its operations are executed or none. There must be no state in a database where a transaction is left partially completed. States should be defined either before the execution of the transaction or after the execution/abortion/failure of the transaction.",5
"The database must remain in a consistent state after any transaction. No transaction should have any adverse effect on the data residing in the database.

"In a database system where more than one transaction are being executed simultaneously and in parallel, the property of isolation states that all the transactions will be carried out and executed as if it is the only transaction in the system. No transaction will affect the existence of any other transaction",5
"The database should be durable enough to hold all its latest updates even if the system fails or restarts. If a transaction updates a chunk of data in a database and commits, then the database will hold the modified data. If a transaction commits but the system fails before the data could be written on to the disk, then that data will be updated once the system springs back into action.",5
"The active state is the first state of every transaction. In this state, the transaction is being executed.
For example: Insertion or deletion or updating a record is done here. But all the records are still not saved to the database. ",5
"In the partially committed state, a transaction executes its final operation, but the data is still not saved to the database.
In the total mark calculation example, a final display of the total marks step is executed in this state.",5
"A transaction is said to be in a committed state if it executes all its operations successfully. In this state, all the effects are now permanently saved on the database system.",5
"If any of the checks made by the database recovery system fails, then the transaction is said to be in the failed state.
In the example of total mark calculation, if the database is not able to fire a query to fetch the marks, then the transaction will fail to execute.",5
If any of the checks fail and the transaction has reached a failed state then the database recovery system will make sure that the database is in its previous consistent state. If not then it will abort or roll back the transaction to bring the database into a consistent state.,5

"A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a collection of programs and capabilities that enable IT teams and others to create, update, administer and otherwise interact with aÂ relational database. RDBMSes store data in the form of tables, with most commercial relational database management systems using Structured Query Language (SQL) to access the database. However, since SQL was invented after the initial development of the relational model, it is not necessary for RDBMS use.

The RDBMS is the most popular database system among organizations across the world. It provides a dependable method of storing and retrieving large amounts of data while offering a combination of system performance and ease of implementation.",4
"The DBMS design depends upon its architecture. The basic client/server architecture is used to deal with a large number of PCs, web servers, database servers and other components that are connected with networks. The client/server architecture consists of many PCs and a workstation which are connected via the network. DBMS architecture depends upon how users are connected to the database to get their request done.",4
"In this architecture, the database is directly available to the user. It means the user can directly sit on the DBMS and uses it. Any changes done here will directly be done on the database itself. It doesn't provide a handy tool for end users. The 1-Tier architecture is used for development of the local application, where programmers can directly communicate with the database for the quick response.",3.5
"The 2-Tier architecture is same as basic client-server. In the two-tier architecture, applications on the client end can directly communicate with the database at the server side. For this interaction, API's like: ODBC, JDBC are used. The user interfaces and application programs are run on the client-side. The server side is responsible to provide the functionalities like: query processing and transaction management. To communicate with the DBMS, client-side application establishes a connection with the server side.",4
"The 3-Tier architecture contains another layer between the client and server. In this architecture, client can't directly communicate with the server. The application on the client-end interacts with an application server which further communicates with the database system. End user has no idea about the existence of the database beyond the application server. The database also has no idea about any other user beyond the application. The 3-Tier architecture is used in case of large web application.",3.5

The concurrency control subsystem of the DBMS enforced the isolation property.",4
"The durability property is used to indicate the performance of the database's consistent state. It states that the transaction made the permanent changes.
They cannot be lost by the erroneous operation of a faulty transaction or by the system failure. When a transaction is completed, then the database reaches a state known as the consistent state. That consistent state cannot be lost, even in the event of a system's failure.

Polymorphism: It enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. d. Abstraction: It simplifies complex systems by modeling classes based on their essential characteristics.,5
"A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class with its own state and behavior.",4
"The main difference is that a class is a template, while an object is an instance created from that template. Classes define the structure, attributes, and behaviors, while objects represent specific instances with their own unique data.",4
"Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, a class. It helps in maintaining the integrity of data by controlling access to it through methods and access modifiers, such as private and public.",4
"Encapsulation ensures that the internal state of an object is not directly accessible from outside the class. It provides data protection and allows controlled modification of the data, preventing unintended interference and maintaining data integrity.",4
"Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass or base class). For example, a ""Car"" class can inherit from a more general ""Vehicle"" class.",4
"Advantages of using inheritance in OOP include code reuse, extensibility, and creating a hierarchy of related classes that models the real-world relationships between objects.",4
private' is an access control modifier in OOP that restricts access to class members (methods and attributes) to only within the same class. It prevents external code from directly accessing or modifying these members.,4
"Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. An example is the use of a base class ""Shape"" that can represent various shapes like circles and rectangles, each with its specific implementation.",4
Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated and serve as blueprints for other classes. They may contain abstract methods that must be implemented by derived classes. They are used to define a common interface for related classes.,4
Method overloading is the ability to define multiple methods in a class with the same name but different parameter lists. Method overriding is the process of redefining a method in a subclass to provide a specific implementation.,5
"OOP supports code reusability through inheritance and composition. Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, while composition involves creating objects of other classes within a class.",4
"Composition is a way to create a complex object by combining simpler objects. In contrast, inheritance involves inheriting and extending the properties and behaviors of an existing class.",4
A constructor is a special method in a class used for initializing the object's state when an object is created. It has the same name as the class and is automatically called when an object is instantiated.,4
"A destructor is a method used to clean up resources and perform final tasks before an object is destroyed. In many object-oriented languages, destructors are automatically called when an object goes out of scope.",4
Static methods and variables belong to the class rather than instances of the class. They are shared across all instances of the class and can be called without creating an object.,4
The 'super' keyword is used in OOP to call a method or constructor from the superclass (base class). It is typically used in a subclass to invoke the constructor or method of the superclass.,4

OOP supports information hiding by encapsulating data and exposing it only through controlled interfaces. It abstracts away the underlying complexity and provides a clear separation between the interface and implementation.,4
"A shallow copy duplicates the object and its immediate references, while a deep copy duplicates the object and all objects referenced by the original recursively.",4
Design patterns in OOP are reusable solutions to common design problems. They provide best practices for structuring and organizing code to address specific concerns in a flexible and maintainable way.,4
"The Observer design pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where one object (the subject) maintains a list of observers (dependents) and notifies them of state changes. A real-world example is a news website that notifies subscribers of new articles.",4
The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is useful when exactly one object needs to coordinate actions across the system.,4
The Factory Method design pattern defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It provides a way to delegate the object creation to derived classes.,4
"The 'final' keyword in OOP is used to indicate that a class, method, or variable is not intended to be further extended, overridden, or modified. It can be used in class definitions to prevent inheritance, in method definitions to prevent overriding, and in variable definitions to indicate a constant value.",4
"In OOP, the ""superclass"" and ""subclass"" relationship is a key aspect of inheritance. A superclass is a class that serves as a base class, providing common attributes and methods. A subclass, on the other hand, is derived from the superclass and inherits its attributes and methods. The subclass can also add its own attributes and methods or override inherited ones. This relationship is also known as ""is-a,"" where the subclass is a specialized version of the superclass, inheriting and extending its characteristics.",4
"""Polymorphism"" in OOP is the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of a common base class. It allows for flexibility in code design by enabling one piece of code to work with objects of different classes in a consistent manner. For example, a generic function can work with various shapes (circles, rectangles, triangles) without needing to know the specific class of the object. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding, where subclasses provide their own implementations of methods defined in the base class.",4
"""Method overriding"" in OOP is the process of providing a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in a superclass. It is used when a subclass wants to customize the behavior of an inherited method. The method in the subclass has the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the superclass. The choice of which method to execute is determined at runtime based on the actual object's type. Method overriding is a key component of polymorphism, allowing code to work with various subclasses uniformly.",4
"In OOP, ""interfaces"" are similar to abstract classes, but they only define method signatures and constants without providing any method implementations. Interfaces are used to define a contract that classes must adhere to, ensuring that certain methods are implemented. The advantage of interfaces is that a class can implement multiple interfaces, promoting code reusability and flexibility. They are particularly useful when different classes share a common set of methods, but their implementations vary.",4
"""Method visibility"" in OOP refers to the access control of class members (methods and attributes). There are three main visibility modifiers: ""public,"" ""private,"" and ""protected."" ""Public"" members are accessible from any part of the program, ""private"" members are only accessible within the same class, and ""protected"" members are accessible within the class and its subclasses. Method visibility is essential for controlling access to class members and maintaining data security and integrity.",4
"A ""constructor"" in OOP is a special method used to initialize objects when they are created. Constructors have the same name as the class and are responsible for setting the initial state of an object. They are typically used to assign initial values to object attributes and perform any necessary setup. Constructors ensure that objects are in a valid state when they are instantiated.",4
"OOP handles ""multiple inheritance"" by allowing a class to inherit from more than one superclass. However, multiple inheritance can lead to ambiguity when a class inherits methods or attributes with the same name from multiple superclasses. To address this, some programming languages, such as Java, support interface-based multiple inheritance, where a class can implement multiple interfaces, but only inherit from one superclass. This helps avoid conflicts and maintain code clarity.",4
"""Aggregation"" and ""composition"" are two forms of object composition in OOP. Aggregation involves a ""has-a"" relationship, where a class contains objects that can exist independently. Composition, on the other hand, involves a stronger ""owns-a"" relationship, where a class contains objects that have a strong lifecycle dependency. In aggregation, the child objects can exist even if the parent object is destroyed, whereas in composition, the child objects are destroyed when the parent object is destroyed.",4
"""Method chaining"" in OOP is a technique where multiple method calls on an object are chained together, typically separated by periods. This allows you to call several methods on an object in a single line of code, improving code readability and design. Method chaining is often used in situations where a series of methods are applied to an object one after the other, and the result of each method call is the same object.",3.5
"In OOP, ""tight coupling"" refers to a strong dependency between classes, where changes in one class may require corresponding changes in other related classes. This can lead to code that is difficult to maintain and extend. ""Loose coupling"" is the opposite, where classes are less dependent on each other and can be modified or replaced without affecting the entire system. Loose coupling is desirable in software architecture because it enhances flexibility, scalability, and maintainability. Design patterns and interfaces are often used to achieve loose coupling in OOP.",3.5

"Database Normalization is a technique of organizing the data in the database. Normalization is a systematic approach of decomposing tables to eliminate data redundancy(repetition) and undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies. It is a multi-step process that puts data into tabular form, removing duplicated data from the relation tables.
Normalization is used for mainly two purposes,
Eliminating redundant(useless) data.
Ensuring data dependencies make sense i.e data is logically stored.",4
"1. Data Redundancy
Unlike traditional file-system storage, Data Redundancy in DBMS is very less or not present. Data Redundancy occurs when the same data are stored unnecessarily at different places. Data Redundancy is reduced or eliminated in DBMS because all data are stored at a centralized location rather than being created by individual users and for each application. 2. Data Inconsistency
In traditional file system storage, the changes made by one user in one application doesnâ€™t update the changes in other application, given both have the same set of details. While this is not the case with DBMS systems as there is a single repository of data that is defined once and is accessed by many users, and data are consistent.
3. Data Sharing

"Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that uses objects, which are instances of classes, to structure and model software. It's important in software development because it promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability of code by organizing data and behavior into self-contained units.",5
"The four fundamental principles of OOP are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

Encapsulation involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit (a class) and controlling access to the data.
Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.
Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, allowing flexibility in method invocation.
Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors.",0
"A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that objects of that class will have.
An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity or item and can interact with other objects and the system.",4
"A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class. Classes define the structure and behavior, while objects are actual instances with specific data and state.",4
"Encapsulation is the principle of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, called a class. It also involves controlling access to the data by using access modifiers like public, private, and protected.",4
"Encapsulation ensures that the internal state of an object is only accessible through well-defined methods (getters and setters), allowing you to maintain control over how the data is accessed and modified. This prevents unauthorized or unintended changes to the data, helping maintain data integrity.",4
"Inheritance allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and establishes an ""is-a"" relationship between the classes. For example, you can have a superclass Vehicle and a subclass Car, where Car inherits characteristics like speed and fuel from Vehicle.",4
"Advantages of inheritance include code reuse, modularity, and the ability to create hierarchies of related classes. It simplifies the design and maintenance of software by allowing common attributes and behaviors to be defined in a superclass and reused in subclasses.",5
"private' is an access modifier that restricts access to class members (attributes or methods) to within the same class. Members declared as 'private' can't be accessed or modified from outside the class, ensuring data encapsulation.",5
"Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on multiple forms. In OOP, it can be achieved through method overriding or method overloading. For example, you can have a Shape class with a draw method, and subclasses like Circle and Rectangle that override the draw method to suit their specific shapes.",5
Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated and serve as templates for other classes. They may contain abstract (unimplemented) methods that must be implemented by subclasses. They are used to define a common interface for a group of related classes.,4.5
"Method overloading is when a class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. The appropriate method is chosen at compile-time based on the number or type of arguments.
Method overriding is when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the superclass.",4.5
"OOP supports code reusability through inheritance and composition. Inheritance allows the reuse of code by creating new classes based on existing classes, and composition involves creating classes that contain instances of other classes to reuse their functionality.",3.5
"Inheritance creates an ""is-a"" relationship between classes, while composition creates a ""has-a"" relationship. Inheritance promotes code reuse by inheriting attributes and methods, while composition involves creating objects of other classes and using them as components in a new class.",3.5
A constructor is a special method in a class that is called when an object of that class is created. Its role is to initialize the object's attributes or perform any necessary setup. Constructors have the same name as the class and may have parameters to accept initial values.,4.5
"A destructor is a special method used to clean up resources when an object is destroyed or goes out of scope. In some languages like C++, destructors are automatically called when the object's lifetime ends, and in others, like Python, it's managed by the garbage collector.",4.5
"Static methods and variables are associated with the class itself rather than instances of the class. Static methods can be called on the class, and static variables are shared among all instances of the class. They are often used for utility methods or constants.",4.5
The 'super' keyword is used to call methods or constructors from the superclass when you are in a subclass. It's typically used in cases of method overriding or when you want to extend the behavior of a superclass method in the subclass.,4.5
"The 'this' keyword refers to the current object within a class, allowing you to access its attributes and methods. It is used to disambiguate between instance variables and method parameters. 'super' is used to access members of the superclass. 'this' and 'super' serve different purposes.",3.5
"Multiple inheritance is a feature where a class can inherit from more than one class. The diamond problem occurs when a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor. It can lead to ambiguity in method resolution, and some programming languages like C++ and Python have mechanisms to handle it.",3.5
"SOLID is an acronym for a set of design principles in OOP:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have a single responsibility.
Open-Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.",3
"An abstract class can have both implemented and abstract methods and can have attributes, whereas an interface only defines a contract for methods that implementing classes must provide. A class can inherit from one abstract class but implement multiple interfaces.",3
"Method chaining, also known as fluent interfaces, is a technique where you design methods that return the current object (usually 'this') so that multiple methods can be called sequentially on the same object. This results in more concise and readable code.",0
"OOP supports information hiding by using access modifiers like 'private,' 'protected,' and 'public' to control the visibility of class members. This restricts direct access to data and allows you to expose only the necessary methods and attributes to the outside world.",4.5
"A shallow copy duplicates the top-level structure of an object but references the same objects that are contained within. Changes to the contained objects affect both the original and the copied object.
A deep copy creates a completely independent duplicate, including all the objects contained within the original. Changes to the copied object do not affect the original.",4.5
"A design pattern is a reusable and general solution to a common problem in software design. They provide best practices and templates for solving recurring design issues, making code more maintainable and easier to understand.",4.5
"The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many relationship between objects. When one object (the subject) changes its state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically. A real-world example is a news subscription, where subscribers are notified when new articles are published.",3.5
"The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is useful when you want to restrict the instantiation of a class to a single object, like a configuration manager or a connection pool.",3.5
"The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It's used when a class cannot anticipate the type of objects it needs to create, and this decision should be left to its subclasses.",3.5
"The 'final' keyword is used to restrict the further extension or overriding of a class, method, or variable. In class definitions, it can be used to indicate that a class cannot be subclassed. In method definitions, it prevents the method from being overridden in derived classes, and in variable definitions, it makes the variable a constant that cannot be changed once initialized.",3.5
"In OOP, the ""superclass"" and ""subclass"" relationship refers to inheritance. The superclass, also known as the base class or parent class, is a class that provides attributes and methods to its subclasses. Subclasses, also called derived classes or child classes, inherit these attributes and methods from the superclass. This relationship allows subclasses to reuse and extend the functionality of the superclass, establishing an ""is-a"" relationship.",3.5
"""Polymorphism"" in OOP refers to the ability of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It allows a single piece of code to work with objects of various subclasses. For example, a method that operates on a base class can be used with different derived classes. Polymorphism ensures that the most appropriate method is executed based on the actual object's type, promoting code reusability and flexibility.",4
"OOP handles ""method overriding"" when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows the subclass to customize the behavior of the inherited method. Method overriding is useful when you want to create more specialized behavior in the subclass while maintaining a consistent method signature. It enables polymorphism and ensures that objects of different classes can be treated uniformly.",4
"""Interfaces"" in OOP define a contract specifying a set of method signatures that implementing classes must adhere to. They provide a way to achieve multiple inheritance in Java. Interfaces are important for achieving abstraction and code reusability by allowing unrelated classes to share a common set of methods without the need for a common base class. Unlike abstract classes, interfaces only define method signatures, not their implementations.",4
"""Method visibility"" in OOP determines who can access and call methods. In OOP, there are three primary visibility levels:

""Public"" methods are accessible from anywhere in the program.
""Private"" methods are only accessible within the class that defines them.
""Protected"" methods are accessible within the class and its subclasses.",4
"A ""constructor"" in OOP is a special method responsible for initializing an object when it's created. Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type. They are called automatically when an object is instantiated and can be used to set initial values for the object's attributes.",4
"OOP handles ""multiple inheritance"" by allowing a class to inherit from multiple superclasses. Multiple inheritance poses challenges in some programming languages, leading to the ""diamond problem."" Some languages, like Java, allow multiple interface inheritance but prevent multiple class inheritance. This limitation is a solution to avoid ambiguities in method resolution.",3.5
"""Aggregation"" and ""composition"" are concepts in OOP for creating classes by combining or composing objects of other classes as attributes. In aggregation, objects have a ""has-a"" relationship, where they can exist independently. In composition, one class is composed of objects of other classes, and they have a stronger ""whole-part"" relationship. Composition implies that the lifetime of the composed objects is controlled by the containing object.",3
"""Method chaining"" is a technique in OOP where a series of method calls is chained together in a single statement. It improves code readability and design by allowing for a more fluent and concise way to interact with objects. Method chaining is often used when multiple methods return the same object, allowing you to call them one after another in a chain.",3
"""Tight coupling"" and ""loose coupling"" refer to the degree of interdependence between classes in a software system. ""Tight coupling"" implies strong dependencies between classes, making it harder to modify or extend the system without affecting other parts. ""Loose coupling"" indicates weaker dependencies, where classes interact through well-defined interfaces, making the system more flexible, maintainable, and easier to change. Loose coupling is a key principle in achieving good software design.",3
"An Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram is a type of flowchart that illustrates how â€œentitiesâ€ such as people, objects or concepts relate to each other within a system. ER Diagrams are most often used to design or debug relational databases in the fields of software engineering, business information systems, education and research. Also known as ERDs or ER Models, they use a defined set of symbols such as rectangles, diamonds, ovals and connecting lines to depict the interconnectedness of entities, relationships and their attributes. They mirror grammatical structure, with entities as nouns and relationships as verbs.",3
"Normalization is a database design technique which organizes tables in a manner that reduces redundancy and dependency of data. 
It divides larger tables to smaller tables and links them using relationships. Normalization means split the tables into small tables which will contain less number of attributes in such a way that table design must not contain any problem of inserting, deleting, updating anomalies and guarantees no redundancy.",3.4

"OOP is a programming paradigm that structures software using objects, which are instances of classes. It's important as it promotes modularity, reusability, and easier maintenance of code.",5
"The four principles are: Encapsulation (data hiding), Inheritance (reusing and extending classes), Polymorphism (multiple behaviors for objects of the same type), and Abstraction (modeling real-world entities).",4.5
"A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class with its own state and behavior.",5
"A class is a blueprint, and an object is an instance of that blueprint. Multiple objects can be created from a single class.",3.5
Encapsulation is the practice of hiding the internal details of an object and providing a controlled interface to interact with it.,3.5
"Encapsulation prevents direct access to an object's internal state, allowing data to be modified only through controlled methods, thus maintaining data integrity.",3.5
"Inheritance allows a new class (subclass/derived) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass/base). Example: A ""Car"" class can inherit from a ""Vehicle"" class.",4.5
"Inheritance promotes code reuse, hierarchical organization, and the ability to model relationships between classes.",4.5
"Private' makes class members accessible only within the class they are defined in, ensuring encapsulation.",4.5
"Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. Example: A ""Shape"" superclass can have subclasses like ""Circle"" and ""Square,"" both with a ""calculateArea"" method.",4.5
Abstract classes cannot be instantiated and serve as blueprints for other classes. They are used to define a common interface for subclasses and enforce method implementations.,4.5
Method overloading is having multiple methods in the same class with different parameters. Method overriding is redefining a method in a subclass with the same signature as the superclass.,4.5
"OOP achieves code reusability through inheritance and composition, allowing classes to inherit or contain attributes and behaviors from other classes.",4.5
"Composition involves creating objects of other classes as attributes within a class, while inheritance is about creating a new class based on an existing class.",3.5
A constructor is a special method used for initializing objects when they are created. It sets initial values and allocates resources.,3
"A destructor is a method used to release resources and clean up an object. It's called when an object is no longer in use, typically when it goes out of scope.",3.5

"SOLID is an acronym for Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. These principles guide good software design and maintainability.",4
"An abstract class can have both defined and undefined methods, while an interface contains only method signatures. A class can implement multiple interfaces but inherit from only one class.",4.5
"Method chaining allows invoking multiple methods on an object in a single line, which is possible when methods return the object itself. It enhances code readability.",4.5
OOP allows encapsulating data and providing controlled access to it. The internal state of an object is hidden from external manipulation.,4.5
"A shallow copy duplicates the object's references but not the referenced objects themselves. A deep copy duplicates the object and all objects it references, recursively.",4.5
"A design pattern is a reusable solution to a common problem in software design. They are used to promote best practices, increase code quality, and solve recurring issues efficiently.",3.5
The Observer pattern allows objects to subscribe and receive updates from a subject when its state changes. A real-world example is a weather station that notifies multiple display devices when weather conditions change.,4.5
"The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access. It is useful when you need to control access to a single resource, like a database connection.",3.5
The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. It's useful for creating objects without specifying the exact class.,4.5
"The 'final' keyword is used to indicate that a class, method, or variable cannot be further extended or overridden. It's often used to prevent modification or extension in certain cases.",3.5
"The ""superclass"" and ""subclass"" relationship in OOP is a fundamental concept that's also known as inheritance. The superclass (or base class) is a class that provides attributes and methods to other classes, known as subclasses (or derived classes).

This relationship is often referred to as an ""is-a"" relationship, where a subclass is a more specific version of the superclass.",2.5
"""Polymorphism"" is a key concept in OOP that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It promotes flexibility and reusability in code design. A practical example of polymorphism is creating a method that can accept different types of objects as parameters, and the method behaves differently based on the actual type of the object it receives.",4
"OOP handles ""method overriding"" when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that's already defined in its superclass. This allows the subclass to customize the behavior of the inherited method. Method overriding is particularly useful when you want to create more specialized behavior for a method in a subclass while preserving the method's name and signature from the superclass.",4.5
"""Interfaces"" in OOP define a contract that specifies a set of methods that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface. Interfaces are used to ensure that specific behaviors are available in classes that implement them. They are different from abstract classes in that a class can implement multiple interfaces, promoting flexibility and reusability.",4
"""Method visibility"" in OOP refers to the accessibility of methods. There are three common visibility modifiers: ""public"" (accessible from anywhere), ""private"" (only accessible within the class), and ""protected"" (accessible within the class and its subclasses). These modifiers control how methods can be accessed and play a role in encapsulation and data protection.",5
"A ""constructor"" in OOP is a special method used to initialize objects of a class.

Constructors are essential in OOP to ensure that objects start with a consistent and valid state.",4.5
"OOP typically doesn't support ""multiple inheritance,"" where a class can inherit from multiple superclasses. This is because it can lead to the ""diamond problem"" and code complexity. Many OOP languages use interfaces to provide a form of multiple inheritance, allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces without inheriting from multiple classes.",4.5
"""Aggregation"" and ""composition"" are used in OOP to represent relationships between objects. Aggregation implies a ""has-a"" relationship, where one class contains another class as a part, but the contained class can exist independently. Composition implies a stronger ownership, where one class is composed of another, and the contained class cannot exist without the container.",4.5

He can assign users to access the database. Others users are also authorized to access database and also they can share data between them. Many users have same authority to access the database.
Data Consistency
DBMS controls data redundancy which in turn controls data consistency. Data consistency means if you want to update data in any files then all the files should not be updated again.

"Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. It's important in software development because it promotes modularity, reusability, and easier maintenance of code.",4.5
a. Encapsulation: It restricts access to an object's internal state and only allows interaction through defined interfaces. b. Inheritance: It allows a new class to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class. c. Polymorphism: It enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. d. Abstraction: It focuses on essential features while hiding unnecessary details.,4
"In OOP, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class.",3.5
"The main difference between a class and an object is that a class is a template or blueprint, while an object is an instance created from that template.",4.5
Encapsulation in OOP is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (class). It helps maintain the integrity of data by controlling access and ensuring data consistency.,4.5
"Encapsulation ensures that data within a class is not directly accessible from outside the class, and it can be modified only through defined methods, allowing for data validation and security.",4.5
"Inheritance in OOP is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass or base class). For example, a ""Car"" class can inherit from a ""Vehicle"" class.",4.5
"Advantages of using inheritance in OOP include code reusability, improved organization of code, and the ability to create specialized classes based on existing ones.",5
The 'private' access control modifier in OOP restricts access to class members (attributes or methods) to within the same class. It prevents external code from directly modifying those members.,4.5
"Polymorphism in OOP allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. For example, a ""Shape"" class can have subclasses like ""Circle"" and ""Rectangle,"" and they can all be treated as ""Shape"" objects.",4.5
"Abstract classes in OOP are classes that cannot be instantiated but serve as a blueprint for other classes. They can have abstract methods, which must be implemented by subclasses.",4.5
"Method overloading is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name in a class, differing in the number or types of parameters. Method overriding is when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in the superclass.",4.5
"OOP supports code reusability through inheritance and composition. Inheritance allows a class to inherit features from another class, and composition allows a class to contain objects of other classes.",4.5
"Composition is a relationship where a class contains one or more objects of another class, while inheritance is a relationship where a class inherits properties and behaviors from another class.",4.5
"In OOP, a constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes.",3.5
"A destructor in OOP is a special method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used for cleanup tasks, but its usage is not as common as constructors.",3.5
"Static methods and variables in OOP are associated with the class itself rather than with specific instances of the class. They are accessed using the class name, not an object.",4.5
The 'super' keyword in OOP is used to call a method or constructor from the superclass. It is typically used to access and call superclass members from a subclass.,3.5
"The 'this' keyword in OOP refers to the current object instance and is used to differentiate between class attributes and parameters with the same name. It differs from 'super,' which refers to the superclass.",4
OOP handles multiple inheritance by allowing a class to inherit from multiple base classes. The diamond problem is a complication that arises when a class inherits from two classes with a common ancestor.,4.2
The SOLID principles in OOP are: a. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) b. Open/Closed Principle (OCP) c. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) d. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) e. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP),3.5
"An abstract class can have both method implementations and abstract methods, while an interface only defines method signatures, and all methods are abstract.",3.5
"Method chaining in OOP is a technique where methods return the current object, allowing multiple method calls to be chained together, enhancing code readability.",3.5
OOP supports information hiding or data abstraction by encapsulating data within classes and exposing only necessary interfaces to interact with that data.,3.5
"In OOP, a shallow copy duplicates the references to objects, while a deep copy creates new copies of the objects themselves, recursively copying all nested objects.",3.5
Design patterns in OOP are recurring solutions to common software design problems. They promote best practices and provide a structured way to solve problems.,5
The Observer design pattern defines a one-to-many relationship between objects. One object (the subject) maintains a list of dependent objects (observers) and notifies them of any state changes.,5
The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is useful when a single object should coordinate actions across the system.,3.5
The Factory Method design pattern defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It promotes loose coupling between the creator and the products it creates.,5
"The 'final' keyword in OOP is used to indicate that a class, method, or variable cannot be further extended, overridden, or modified. It is often used for classes to prevent inheritance or for methods to prevent overriding.",3.5
"The ""superclass"" and ""subclass"" relationship in OOP is a form of inheritance, where a subclass inherits attributes and methods from a superclass. The superclass provides a common set of characteristics and behaviors, while the subclass is a specialized version that can add, modify, or extend these attributes and methods.",4.5
"""Polymorphism"" in OOP allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables writing code that can work with various subclasses, improving code flexibility and reusability. For example, a common base class can have a method, and different subclasses can provide their own implementations.",4.5
"""Method overriding"" occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. It allows customization of behavior in the subclass and is crucial for achieving polymorphism, as the choice of which method to execute is determined at runtime based on the actual object's type.",4.5
"""Interfaces"" in OOP define a contract that a class must adhere to by implementing specific methods. They are used to achieve multiple inheritance of behavior and are different from abstract classes, as a class can implement multiple interfaces but inherit from only one class.",4.5
"Method visibility in OOP is controlled by access modifiers like ""public,"" ""private,"" and ""protected."" ""Public"" methods are accessible from anywhere, ""private"" methods are only accessible within the class that defines them, and ""protected"" methods are accessible within the class and its subclasses.",3.5
"A ""constructor"" in OOP is a special method used for initializing objects when they are created. It sets the initial state of an object and often takes parameters to provide values for object attributes. Constructors are essential for object creation and setup.",4
"OOP handles ""multiple inheritance"" by allowing a class to inherit from multiple superclasses. It presents challenges related to ambiguity and complexity. To address this, some languages like Java support multiple interface implementation, where a class can implement multiple interfaces, avoiding issues associated with multiple inheritance.",4
"""Aggregation"" and ""composition"" in OOP represent different relationships between classes. Aggregation is a ""has-a"" relationship where one class is composed of other objects, which can exist independently. Composition is a stronger ""owns-a"" relationship where one class owns and is responsible for the existence of another class.",4
"""Method chaining"" in OOP is a design pattern where methods return the object on which they were called, allowing multiple methods to be chained together in a single statement. This improves code readability and can make the code more expressive.",4
"""Tight coupling"" and ""loose coupling"" refer to the degree of interdependence between different components or modules in a software system. ""Tight coupling"" implies strong dependencies between components, making them difficult to change independently, while ""loose coupling"" signifies that components are more independent and can be changed without affecting each other. Loose coupling is a desirable design principle for better software maintainability and flexibility.",4
