evaluate the quality of content in educational assessments by integrating image processing techniques, natural language processing (NLP), and cosine similarity. Image processing algorithms are used to extract relevant features from text, including layouts and graphics, to improve the response. Additionally, the text is processed using the Bidirectional Encoder Representation (BERT) model to capture ambiguous content. The fusion mechanism combines visual and textual data for easy analysis. Cosine similarity is used to measure the similarity between student and reference responses. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, achieving greater accuracy and robustness compared to traditional methods, reducing dependence on human observers, and minimizing errors. This research contributes to the evaluation of education by measuring the quality of responses with reliable, valid and objective methods.
