Observation Table:

For Non-inverting Amplifier:

Practical gain Theoretical gain
A,= Vout / Vin A, = 1+ (R:/ R:)
1div*2v/div=2div*2vdiv= 1+2=3

Conclusion:

1) Theoretical Voltage gain=Practical Voltage Gain for inverting and non

invertingamplifiers.

2) Thus we have studied how to simulate Inverting and Non Inverting

amplifiers usingOp-amp.
