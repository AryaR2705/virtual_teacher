Applying KCL at inverting node we can calculate voltage gain,

Voltage gain (A)= Vou/ Vin=— Re/Rin

Circuit of Non-inverting amplifier:-

The non-inverting amplifier is one in which the output is in phase with respect to the input.
The feedback is applied at the inverting input. However, the input is now applied at the non-
inverting input. The output is a non-Inverted (in terms of phase) amplified version of
input. The gain of the non-inverting amplifier circuit for the operational amplifier is easy to

determine.

& Vout

The voltage gain can be calculated by applying KCL at the inverting node,

Voltage gain (A) = Vou/ Vin= 1+ (Re/ Ro)
