Aim: Simulate Inverting and Non-inverting amplifier using Op-amp.

Software: Multisim software

Theory:

It is basic job of operational amplifier is to amplify the signal .Op-amp circuit is
built using different capacitors and registers. Op-amp is able to perform different
mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, differentiation and integration.
It amplifies the difference between two input signals. It is also called as differential

amplifier.

Circuit of Inverting amplifier:-

In an inverting amplifier circuit, the operational amplifier inverting input receives
feedback from the output of the amplifier. Assuming the op-amp is ideal and applying the
concept of virtual short at the input terminals of op-amp, the voltage at the inverting terminal
is equal to non-inverting terminal. The non-inverting input of the operational amplifier 1s
connected to ground. As the gain of the op amp itself 1s very high and the output from the
amplifier is a matter of only a few volts, this means that the difference between the two input
terminals is exceedingly small and can be ignored. As the non-inverting input of the
operational amplifier is held at ground potential this means that the inverting input must be

virtually at earth potential.
